# Count divisors of product of array elements 
## _Medium Accuracy: 85.19% Submissions: 3163 Points: 4_ 

_*Given an array with N elements, the task is to find the count of factors of a number X which is product of all array elements.*_
 

# Example 1:

Input:
N = 3
Arr[] = {2, 4, 6}
Output:
10
## Explanation:
2 * 4 * 6 = 48, the factors of 48 are 
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48
whose count is 10.
 

# Example 2:

Input:
N = 3
Arr[] = {3, 5, 7}
Output:
8
## Explanation:
3 * 5 * 7 = 105, the factors of 105 are 
1, 3, 5, 7, 15, 21, 35, 105 whose count is 8.
 

# Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function countDivisorsMult() which takes the array A[] and its size N as inputs and returns the count of factors of X.

 

# Expected Time Complexity: O(N. sqrt(N))
# Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

 

Constraints:
2<=N<=102
1<=Arr[i]<=102
